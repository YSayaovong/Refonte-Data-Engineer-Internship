# Call Logs Aggregator

This project demonstrates an efficient and scalable approach to aggregating call durations for multiple users. It simplifies data processing tasks and showcases key concepts of dynamic data grouping, programmatic calculations, and clear result presentation using Python.

## Key Features

### **1. Input Data Processing**:
- Accepts a list of user call logs as input.
- Example call logs: ('user1', 120) ('user1', 120) ('user2', 60) ('user2', 30) ('user3', 300)

### **2. Dynamic Data Grouping**:
- Groups call durations dynamically by user using `defaultdict`.

### **3. Data Aggregation**:
- Aggregates call durations for each user programmatically.

### **4. Clear and Concise Output**:
- Displays results in an easy-to-read format.
- Example output: user1: 240 seconds user2: 90 seconds user3: 300 seconds

## Accomplishments

### **Data Aggregation**:
- Built a Python-based tool to efficiently aggregate call durations.
- Ensured accurate and reliable results for grouped data.

### **Algorithm Design**:
- Leveraged Python's `defaultdict` for simplified and efficient handling of dynamic data.
- Eliminated manual key initialization through a built-in solution.

### **Results Output**:
- Programmatically calculated and displayed total call durations for each user.
- Presented data clearly and concisely for easy interpretation.

### **Problem Solving**:
- Applied Python programming concepts to solve a real-world scenario of grouped data processing.

### **Modular and Extendable Code**:
- Designed the program for easy customization:
- Adding more users or call logs.
- Extending functionality for filtering or sorting results.
