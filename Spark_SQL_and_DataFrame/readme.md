# Spark SQL and DataFrame Project: Sales Analysis

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of PySpark for performing SQL-like operations and DataFrame transformations on a dataset representing sales transactions. The dataset includes information such as sales dates, store IDs, product details, quantities sold, and customer IDs. By leveraging PySpark's powerful analytical capabilities, key insights were derived from the data.

## Key Features and Accomplishments

1. **Setup and Initialization**:
   - Installed and configured PySpark to enable large-scale data processing.
   - Initialized a Spark session as the entry point for DataFrame and SQL operations.

2. **Data Preparation**:
   - Defined a schema to ensure structured representation of the data.
   - Created a PySpark DataFrame from a sample sales dataset.

3. **Data Exploration and Analysis**:
   - Displayed the dataset to verify its structure and content.
   - Performed various analytical operations:
     - Aggregated total quantities sold for each product.
     - Filtered transactions specific to a given product (`Product_A`).
     - Sorted data by date to analyze chronological trends.
     - Calculated total sales per store, providing insights into store-level performance.

4. **Insights Derived**:
   - Identified the most and least sold products based on total quantities.
   - Determined the sales contributions of individual stores.
   - Highlighted sales patterns specific to `Product_A`.

## Technologies Used

- **PySpark**: A powerful framework for big data processing and analytics.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For an interactive and iterative development environment.
