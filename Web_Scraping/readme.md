# Web Scraping with Python

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the process of web scraping using Python. The notebook leverages essential libraries like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to extract data from web pages and process it programmatically.

## Features and Accomplishments

1. **Library Imports**:
   - Imported necessary libraries including:
     - `requests`: To send HTTP requests and fetch HTML content of web pages.
     - `BeautifulSoup` (from `bs4`): For parsing HTML content and navigating the DOM structure.

2. **Web Page Selection**:
   - Targeted the website `http://quotes.toscrape.com/` for web scraping.

3. **HTTP Requests**:
   - Used `requests.get()` to fetch the webpage's HTML content and stored it for further parsing.

4. **HTML Parsing**:
   - Utilized `BeautifulSoup` to parse the HTML content, allowing for structured extraction of specific elements from the webpage.

5. **Data Extraction**:
   - Scraped quotes and other relevant elements from the webpage and displayed them in a structured format.

6. **Dynamic Web Scraping**:
   - Implemented logic to handle pagination, enabling the extraction of data across multiple pages of the website.
